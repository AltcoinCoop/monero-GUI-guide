On this page you can choose between three options:

1. *Create a new wallet* - Start the procedure to make a new [wallet](https://getmonero.org/resources/moneropedia/wallet.html) from scratch. Choose this option if it's the first time you are creating a wallet.
2. *Restore wallet from keys or mnemonic seed* - Click here if you want to recover a pre-existent wallet using the mnemonic seed or the keys (This is also the option for creating a 'watch-only wallet')
3. *Open a wallet from file* - Choosing this option you will have to select the file in the ".keys" format from a previus wallet
4. check *testnet* if you are going to make tests and not using the main net

## 1. Create new wallet

Now give a name to your wallet (in this example is *testname*), write down your [mnemonic seed](https://getmonero.org/resources/moneropedia/mnemonicseed.html) and keep it safe. Your seed is the master key of your wallet, you can use it to recovery your funds.
